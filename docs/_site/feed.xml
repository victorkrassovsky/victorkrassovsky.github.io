<p>Quantum information systems are built up of four components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>States</li>
  <li>Dynamics</li>
  <li>Measurements</li>
  <li>Observables</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="states">States</h3>
<p>States are made up of qubits which are complex vectors in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ which is just a vector space equiped with an inner product. We use Dirac notation to denote the state of these qubits, e.g. $|\psi \rangle $ with $|\psi|^2=1$, and the inner product of two states is $\langle \psi | \varphi\rangle$. In two dimensions, a basis can be formed with the states $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1\rangle$ and the other states can be written as a complex linear combination of this basis. Hence, for any $| \psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}$,</p>

\[| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle\]

<p>with the condition that $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.</p>

<h3 id="dynamics">Dynamics</h3>
<p>Dynamics describe how the quantum system changes over time. They are usually characterized by gates which are linear transformations of the states. Some common gates are the Pauli matrices:</p>

\[X=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}, Y=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; -i\\ i &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}, Z = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>Quantum gates are unitary and hermitian. Another important matrix is the Hadmard transformation</p>

\[H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>which transforms the orthanormal standard basis to another orthanormal basis $H|0\rangle =|+\rangle$, $H|1\rangle =|-\rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>
<p>Measurements are the way by which observations are made about a quantum system. They are described by a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) whose values are positive semi-definite operators. In other words, with our Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, we associate a measure $ { M_i } $ with the property</p>

\[\sum M_i = I.\]

<p>When a state $|\psi\rangle$ is measured, an outcome is determined with some probability. The probability is determined via Bornâ€™s rule:</p>

\[p_i = \langle \psi | M_i | \psi \rangle\]

<p>We can verify that this is indeed a probability distribution as each probability is nonnegative and</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\sum p_i &amp;= \sum \langle \psi | M_i | \psi \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \psi | \sum M_i |\psi \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \psi | I | \psi \rangle\\
&amp;= |\psi|^2\\
&amp;= 1
\end{align*}\]
