<p>Quantum information systems are built up of four components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>States</li>
  <li>Dynamics</li>
  <li>Measurements</li>
  <li>Observables</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="states">States</h3>
<p>States are made up of qubits which are complex vectors in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ which is just a vector space equiped with an inner product. We use Dirac notation to denote the state of these qubits, e.g. $|\psi \rangle $ with $|\psi|^2=1$, and the inner product of two states is $\langle \psi | \varphi\rangle$. In two dimensions, a basis can be formed with the states $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1\rangle$ and the other states can be written as a complex linear combination of this basis. Hence, for any $| \psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}$,</p>

\[| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle\]

<p>with the condition that $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.</p>

<h3 id="dynamics">Dynamics</h3>
<p>Dynamics describe how the quantum system changes over time. They are usually characterized by gates which are linear transformations of the states. Some common gates are the Pauli matrices:</p>

\[X=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}, Y=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; -i\\ i &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}, Z = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>Quantum gates are unitary and hermitian. Another important matrix is the Hadmard transformation</p>

\[H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>which transforms the orthanormal standard basis to another orthanormal basis $H|0\rangle =|+\rangle$, $H|1\rangle =|-\rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>
<p>Measurements are the way by which observations are made about a quantum system. They are described by a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) whose values are positive semi-definite operators. In other words, with our Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, we associate a measure $ { M_i } $ with the property</p>

\[\sum M_i = I.\]

<p>When a state $|\psi\rangle$ is measured, an outcome is determined with some probability. The probability is determined via Bornâ€™s rule:</p>

\[p_i = \langle \psi | M_i | \psi \rangle\]

<p>We can verify that this is indeed a probability distribution as each probability is nonnegative and</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\sum p_i &amp;= \sum \langle \psi | M_i | \psi \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \psi | \sum M_i |\psi \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \psi | I | \psi \rangle\\
&amp;= |\psi|^2\\
&amp;= 1
\end{align*}\]

<h3 id="observables">Observables</h3>
<p>Observables are physical properties that can be observed about a system. They are represented by self-adjoint operators on the system. We write</p>

\[A = A^{t} = \sum_i a_i M_i\]

<p>for some coefficients $a_i\in \mathbb{R}$ and $M_i$ the set of POVMs. We write the expectation of $A$ with respect to sum state $| \psi \rangle$ as</p>

\[\langle A\rangle_\psi = \langle \psi | A |\psi\rangle = \langle \psi |\sum_i a_i M_i|\psi \rangle = \sum_i a_ip_i.\]

<h2 id="single-qubit">Single Qubit</h2>

<p>###Experiment</p>

<p>We write the standard normal basis vectors in two dimensions</p>

\[|0 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}, |1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]

<p>For any state $|\psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}_2=\text{span} (|0\rangle, |1\rangle)$ we can write</p>

\[|\psi \rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle\]

<p>for complex $\alpha, \beta$ with $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2=1$. With this condition, we can parameterize $\alpha = e^{ia}\cos \frac{\theta}{2}$ and $\beta = e^{ib}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}$ for real $a,b,\theta$. Furthermore, we can observe that if $|\tilde{\psi}\rangle = e^{i\gamma}|\psi\rangle$, then for some POVM $M$,</p>

\[\langle \tilde{\psi} | M | \tilde{\psi}\rangle = \langle \psi | M | \psi \rangle\]

<p>so $|\psi \rangle$ and $|\tilde{\psi}\rangle$ are indistinguishable as far as we can measure. In this sense, they are the same, so we can write $\phi=b-a$. Hence,</p>

\[|\psi \rangle = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} + e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}.\]

<h3 id="mixed-states">Mixed States</h3>

<p>Mixed states describe qubits that are have probabilistic combinations of pure states, or qubits that are entangled with other qubits. We will discuss entanglement later as it relies on understanding the interaction of multiple qubits, but both situations are impossible to describe with ordinary wave functions. Instead they are described by density matrices.</p>

<p>Flip a coin with probability of heads $q_0$ and tails $q_1$ and based on the result release a particle with state $|\psi_1\rangle$ or $|\psi_2\rangle$. Then, for a given POVM $M_i$, the associated probability is</p>

\[p_i = q_0\langle \psi_0 | M_i | \psi_1\rangle + q_1\langle \psi_0 | M_i | \psi_1\rangle.\]

<p>Now we use the trick that $\text{tr} A|\psi \rangle \langle \psi |=\langle \psi | A|\psi\rangle$ to get</p>

\[\begin{align*}
p_i &amp;= q_0 \text{tr}(M_i |\psi_0\rangle \langle\psi_0 |)+q_1\text{tr}(M_i |\psi_1\rangle \langle \psi_1 | )\\
&amp;= \text{tr}(M_i (q_0|\psi_0\rangle \langle \psi_0 |+q_1|\psi_1\rangle\langle \psi_1|)).
\end{align*}\]

<p>We call the matrix $q_0|\psi_0\rangle \langle \psi_0 |+q_1 |\psi_1\rangle\langle \psi_1|$ the density matrix that describes the state of the qubit. In general, if a particle has $\psi_i$ with probability $q_i$, the density matrix is</p>

\[\rho = \sum_i q_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |.\]]]></content><author><name>Victor Krassovsky</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantum Systems Quantum information systems are built up of four components: States Dynamics Measurements Observables]]></summary></entry></feed>
