<p>Quantum information systems are built up of four components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>States</li>
  <li>Dynamics</li>
  <li>Measurements</li>
  <li>Observables</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="states">States</h3>
<p>States are made up of qubits which are complex vectors in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ which is just a vector space equiped with an inner product. We use Dirac notation to denote the state of these qubits, e.g. $|\psi \rangle $ with $|\psi|^2=1$, and the inner product of two states is $\langle \psi | \varphi\rangle$. In two dimensions, a basis can be formed with the states $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1\rangle$ and the other states can be written as a complex linear combination of this basis. Hence, for any $| \psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}$,</p>

\[| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle\]

<p>with the condition that $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.</p>

<h3 id="dynamics">Dynamics</h3>
<p>Dynamics describe how the quantum system changes over time. They are usually characterized by gates which are linear transformations of the states. Some common gates are the Pauli matrices:</p>

\[X=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}, Y=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; -i\\ i &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}, Z = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>Quantum gates are unitary and hermitian. Another important matrix is the Hadmard transformation</p>

\[H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>which transforms the orthanormal standard basis to another orthanormal basis $H|0\rangle =|+\rangle$, $H|1\rangle =|-\rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>
<p>Measurements are the way by which observations are made about a quantum system. They are described by a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) whose values are positive semi-definite operators. In other words, with our Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, we associate a measure $ { M_i } $ with the property</p>

\[\sum M_i = I.\]

<p>When a state $|\psi\rangle$ is measured, an outcome is determined with some probability. The probability is determined via Born’s rule:</p>

\[p_i = \langle \psi | M_i | \psi \rangle\]

<p>We can verify that this is indeed a probability distribution as each probability is nonnegative and</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\sum p_i &amp;= \sum \langle \psi | M_i | \psi \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \psi | \sum M_i |\psi \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \psi | I | \psi \rangle\\
&amp;= |\psi|^2\\
&amp;= 1
\end{align*}\]

<h3 id="observables">Observables</h3>
<p>Observables are physical properties that can be observed about a system. They are represented by self-adjoint operators on the system. We write</p>

\[A = A^{t} = \sum_i a_i M_i\]

<p>for some coefficients $a_i\in \mathbb{R}$ and $M_i$ the set of POVMs. We write the expectation of $A$ with respect to sum state $| \psi \rangle$ as</p>

\[\langle A\rangle_\psi = \langle \psi | A |\psi\rangle = \langle \psi |\sum_i a_i M_i|\psi \rangle = \sum_i a_ip_i.\]

<h2 id="single-qubit">Single Qubit</h2>

<h3 id="experiment">Experiment</h3>

<p>We write the standard normal basis vectors in two dimensions</p>

\[|0 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}, |1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]

<p>For any state $|\psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}_2=\text{span} (|0\rangle, |1\rangle)$ we can write</p>

\[|\psi \rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle\]

<p>for complex $\alpha, \beta$ with $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2=1$. With this condition, we can parameterize $\alpha = e^{ia}\cos \frac{\theta}{2}$ and $\beta = e^{ib}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}$ for real $a,b,\theta$. Furthermore, we can observe that if $|\tilde{\psi}\rangle = e^{i\gamma}|\psi\rangle$, then for some POVM $M$,</p>

\[\langle \tilde{\psi} | M | \tilde{\psi}\rangle = \langle \psi | M | \psi \rangle\]

<p>so $|\psi \rangle$ and $|\tilde{\psi}\rangle$ are indistinguishable as far as we can measure. In this sense, they are the same, so we can write $\phi=b-a$. Hence,</p>

\[|\psi \rangle = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} + e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}.\]

<h3 id="mixed-states">Mixed States</h3>

<p>Mixed states describe qubits that are have probabilistic combinations of pure states, or qubits that are entangled with other qubits. We will discuss entanglement later as it relies on understanding the interaction of multiple qubits, but both situations are impossible to describe with ordinary wave functions. Instead they are described by density matrices.</p>

<p>Flip a coin with probability of heads $q_0$ and tails $q_1$ and based on the result release a particle with state $|\psi_1\rangle$ or $|\psi_2\rangle$. Then, for a given POVM $M_i$, the associated probability is</p>

\[p_i = q_0\langle \psi_0 | M_i | \psi_1\rangle + q_1\langle \psi_0 | M_i | \psi_1\rangle.\]

<p>Now we use the trick that $\text{tr} A|\psi \rangle \langle \psi |=\langle \psi | A|\psi\rangle$ to get</p>

\[\begin{align*}
p_i &amp;= q_0 \text{tr}(M_i |\psi_0\rangle \langle\psi_0 |)+q_1\text{tr}(M_i |\psi_1\rangle \langle \psi_1 | )\\
&amp;= \text{tr}(M_i (q_0|\psi_0\rangle \langle \psi_0 |+q_1|\psi_1\rangle\langle \psi_1|)).
\end{align*}\]

<p>We call the matrix $q_0|\psi_0\rangle \langle \psi_0 |+q_1 |\psi_1\rangle\langle \psi_1|$ the density matrix that describes the state of the qubit. In general, if a particle has state $|\psi_i\rangle$ with probability $q_i$, the density matrix is</p>

\[\rho = \sum_i q_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |.\]

<p>The primary building block of secure communication is symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is described with a pair of ciphers $E$ and $D$ a secret key $k$. In other words, given a key space $\mathcal{K}$, a message space $\mathcal{M}$, and a cipher space $\mathcal{C}$, a cipher is a pair of “efficient” algorithms $E:\mathcal{K}\times \mathcal{M}\to \mathcal{C}$ and $D:\mathcal{K}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{M}$ so that</p>

\[D(k,E(k,m))=m\]

<p>for all $k\in \mathcal{K}$ and $m\in \mathcal{M}$.</p>

<h2 id="one-time-pad">One Time Pad</h2>

<p>One time pad is a symmetric encryption scheme in which the key is as long as the plaintext. Both the key and the plaintext are represented by strings of bits, and the encryption and decryption algorithms simply take the XOR of both their arguments. In other words,</p>

\[E(k,m)=k\oplus m, D(c,m)=c\oplus m.\]

<p>This does indeed satisfy the condition of consistency as $D(k,E(k,m))=k\oplus k\oplus m=0\oplus m=m$.</p>

<p>One time pad is a useful concept as it is secure and has fast encryption and decryption algorithms, but it is impractical as the key needs to be as long as the key plaintext.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the security of OTP, it is necessary to first define what theoretic security is. We say that a cipher $(E,D)$ over $(\mathcal{K},\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{C})$ has perfect secrecy if $\forall m_0,m_1\in \mathcal{M}$ with $len(m_0)=len(m_1)$, $\forall c\in \mathcal{C}$,</p>

\[P(E(k,m_0)=c) = P(E(k,m_1)=c)\]

<p>where $k$ is uniform on $\mathcal{K}$. In other words, the cipher text does not provide any information about the plain text, as any plain text has an equal probability of being correct, if the key is chosen uniformly at random. Essentially, this means that the encryption scheme is invulnerable to cipher text attacks.</p>

<p>We can now prove that OTP indeed has perfect secrecy. We first need a lemma:</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1.1</strong> If $A,B$ are distributed at random on $(0,1)^n$ with $B$ distributed uniformly, then $A\oplus B$ is also distributed uniformly.<br />
<em>Proof:</em> We use the law of total probability and the fact that $f(b)=b\oplus c$ is bijective on $(0,1)^n$:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
P(A\oplus B = c) &amp;= \sum_{b\in (0,1)^n}P(A\oplus B=c | B=b)P(B=b)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{b\in (0,1)^n}P(A\oplus b = c)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{b\in(0,1)^n}P(A=b\oplus c)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{a\in (0,1)^n}P(A=a)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n}.
\end{align*}\]

<p><strong>Theorem 1.2</strong> OTP has perfect secrecy.<br />
<em>Proof:</em> We have that $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{K}=(0,1)^n$. Let $m_0,m_1\in \mathcal{M}$ and $c\in \mathcal{C}$ be given and let $k\leftarrow \mathcal{K}$ be chosen uniformly at random. Then, from the lemma $E(k,m_0)=k\oplus m_0$ and $E(k,m_1)=k\oplus m_1$ are uniform on $\mathcal{C}$, hence</p>

\[P(E(k,m_0)=c)=P(E(k,m_1)).\]

<p>So, OTP is prefectly secure.</p>

<h3 id="pseudorandom-generators">Pseudorandom Generators</h3>

<p>The issue with OTP is that keys need to be as long as the plaintext, hence encrypting messages is costly. Moreover, if there is a mechanism by which two parties can exchange keys securely, they could just use it to send messages instead. One might try to reuse a key $k$ to send two encrypted messages $m_0$ and $m_1$, which is called two time pad. This is insecure, however, as if an attacked XORs the cipher texts, they get $m_0\oplus m_1$. Then, if an attacker knows anything at all about the content of the plaintext, being english sentences for instance, then they can recover the plaintexts $m_0$ and $m_1$. Therefore, keys should never be used more than once.</p>
